# Call for Compositions

Compositions by postgraduate taught and research students are invited for The Hermes Experiment (soprano, clarinet, harp, double bass). They may be a movement or excerpt of a larger work (up to 5 minutes long). Selected composition will be workshopped by the Hermes Experiment.

Submission Guidelines: Compositions should be submitted in PDF format accompanied by a brief text of no more than 250 words outlining poetic and technical aspects of the piece, and a biography of no more than 100 words. The text should be submitted through the application portal. Please also provide the following information when submitting your proposal through the application portal: name, email address, institutional affiliation, programme of study, year of composition. A PDF of the score should be submitted to rsc2022@plymouth.ac.uk.

Composers whose works are selected will be responsible for producing performing materials at their own expense, and these will need to be available by the end of November.


# Call for Electroacoustic Compositions
Electroacoustic compositions (no more than 10 minutes) by postgraduate and research students are invited for performance over a diffusion system. Electroacoustic pieces including acoustic instruments are possible if you arrange for your own performers and instruments. Pieces will be workshopped by Professor Eduardo Miranda and performed live during an electroacoustic composition session at the conference.

Submission Guidelines: Pieces should be accompanied by a brief text of no more than 250 words outlining poetic and technical aspects of the piece. The text and a link to the composition file (e.g. Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.) should be submitted through the application portal. Please also provide the following information when submitting your proposal through the application portal: name, email address, institutional affiliation, programme of study, year of composition.

Electroacoustic compositions should be submitted at 44.1kHz sampling rate. Multi-channel works are permitted, but due to performance restrictions, must not require more than 8 channels. Multi-channel submissions should be a stereo downmix; full multi-channel will be requested upon acceptance.
