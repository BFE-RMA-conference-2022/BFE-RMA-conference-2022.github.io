# Call for Compositions

Compositions are invited for the Hermes Experiment (soprano, clarinet, harp, double bass). They may be a movement or excerpt of a larger work (up to 5 minutes long). Selected composition will be workshopped by the Hermes Experiment.

Submission Guidelines: Compositions should be submitted in PDF format accompanied by a brief text of no more than 250 words outlining poetic and technical aspects of the piece. These materials should be submitted through the application portal. Please also provide the following information when submitting your proposal through the application portal: name, email address, institutional affiliation, programme of study, year of composition. Composers whose works are selected will be responsible for producing performing materials at their own expense, and these will need to be available by XXX.
