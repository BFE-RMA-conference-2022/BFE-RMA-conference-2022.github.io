##### The School of Society and Culture at the University of Plymouth is delighted to host the British Forum for Ethnomusicology and Royal Musical Association Research Students’ Conference from January 6 to 8, 2022. The Research Students Conference is an excellent opportunity for PhD students to gain valuable presentation experience in a friendly and welcoming environment, amongst peers and established academics. The conference seeks to create dialogue across the different strands of music scholarship (musicology, ethnomusicology, popular music studies), as well as featuring composition workshops and performances. Alongside presentations and composers’ workshops, the conference will also feature various training workshops for PhD students wishing to pursue careers within and outside of academia.
